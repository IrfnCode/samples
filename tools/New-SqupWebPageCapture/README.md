# New-SqupWebPageCapture #

This is a place holder for the blog that will be posted soon.

## Description ##

This folder contains two PowerShell scripts that enable the capture of a web page to an image with variable screen size.

The first script, `Install-SqupWebPageCapture.ps1` installs and configures NodeJS and Puppeteer on your system.

The second script, `New-SqupWebPageCapture.ps1`, is the actual capture script.

More documentation and blog post to follow soon.
