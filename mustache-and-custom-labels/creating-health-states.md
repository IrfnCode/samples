# Health state

---

### Convert specific property values
This converts the value of a given property to determine health state, for example converting one or more numbers to readable words. In this example, if the property of `state` is `0` we convert to `healthy`, if its `1` or `2` we convert to `warning`, and if all else fails, we convert to `critical`.

`{{ state == 0 ? "healthy" : ((state == 1 || state == 2) ? "warning" : "criticial" }}`

---

### Convert from a range or threshold
This uses a range of possible values in the `responsetime` property to determine health state, for example under/over a tolerance limit. In this example, if `responsetime` is less than `100` we return `healthy`, if its over `500` we return `critical`, and for everything else / in-between, we return `warning`.

`{{ responsetime < 100 ? "healthy" : responsetime > 500 ? "critical" : "warning" }}`
